    "Lectures 22 â€“ 27 introduce the techniques used to solve quantum chemistry problems using gate-based quantum computers, with emphasis on superconducting qubits. The first three lectures describe the structure of quantum chemistry problems and discuss methods for converting these problems into ones that can be mapped onto a gate-based quantum computer, while the next three lectures focus on extracting the best performance from the quantum hardware to solve quantum chemistry problems by implementing variational quantum eigensolvers.\n",
