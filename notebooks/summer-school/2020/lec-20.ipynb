    "Lectures 16 â€“ 21 introduce the hardware used for quantum computation, with emphasis on superconducting qubits. The first three lectures discuss how to build a superconducting transmon quantum bit (qubit) out of an anharmonic oscillator using Josephson junctions, while the next three lectures focus on coupling to the qubit in a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture.\n",
